Hi, you'll find here a way to convert your systems fonts to SVG fonts. 

You'll have to install fontforge for this.  The command line version
(without GUI) is enough for the tasks here. Then

$ ./mkallfonts

should do the job. You can add other directories to mkallfonts.

WARNING: Depending on your system there could be a lot of fonts requiring a
lot of storage.

Have Fun!
